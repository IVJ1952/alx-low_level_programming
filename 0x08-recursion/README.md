7. They say we only use a fraction of our brain's true potential. Now that's when we're awake. When we're asleep, we can do almost anything

Write a function that returns 1 if a string is a palindrome and 0 if not.

Prototype: int is_palindrome(char *s);

An empty string is a palindrome





8. Inception. Now, before you bother telling me it's impossible...

Write a function that compares two strings and returns 1 if the strings can be considered identical, otherwise return 0.

Prototype: int wildcmp(char *s1, char *s2);

s2 can contain the special character *.

The special char * can replace any string (including an empty string)
